Channelge 13 Object-Relational Mapping
E-Commerce Back End
Project Info
I built the back end for an e-commerce site. We were also given started code that required modifying. I configured an Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

We were asked to provide a link to a video that demonstrates the projects functionality since we did not deploy the application. The link will be provided below.

Purpose
A manager or owner of an internet retail company could use this application as a back end for their e-commerce website.
Features
When a user adds their database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
they are able to connect to a database using Sequelize.
When the user enters schema and seed commands, a development database is created and is seeded with test data
When the user enters the command to invoke the application, their server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.
When the user opens API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags, the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.
When the user tests API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, they are able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
